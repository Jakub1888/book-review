# About

This blog originated as a programming project with the goal of experimenting with new technologies.

From the very beginning, the primary focus of the blog was not clearly outlined. After careful consideration, I chose a subject I have been passionate about for years: the literary works of authors from the American South.

The American South boasts a rich literary tradition dating back to the 18th century, characterized by themes of religion, slavery, and social class. One of its notable subgenres is Southern Gothic, exploring themes of alienation, violence, dark humor, and grotesqueness. Characters in this genre are often depicted as physically or mentally deformed and disabled.

Some of the prominent authors in Southern Fiction include William Faulkner, Mark Twain, Flannery O'Connor, Carson McCullers, Harper Lee, and Cormac McCarthy.
